    <h1>City of Santa Monica Tenant Protections</h1>
    <h3>The information below is provided by Tenants Together, based partially on research conducted by the Urban Displacement Project, and was last updated in October 2018. For complete information on the City's tenant protections, please visit their website <a href="https://www.smgov.net/"target="_blank">here.</a> </h3>
    <h3>Disclaimer: This website is for general information and none of the information provided constitutes legal advice.

    <h4><b>Rent control</b> is effective at keeping people in their homes. Rent control policies limit rent increases and provide greater housing stability for tenants. Rent control ordinances in California allow landlords to set the initial rent in any amount, but limit rent increases after a tenancy begins. </h4>
    <h4>Rent control is often combined with eviction protections, known as <b>"just cause for eviction,"</b> to make sure that landlords do not get around the rent increase limits by simply evicting tenants arbitrarily and bringing in new tenants. Just Cause protections provide basic fairness and prevent retaliation, discrimination, and harassment proactively.</h4>
